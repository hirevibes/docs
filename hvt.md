# Hirevibes Tokens (HVT)
There will be a <u>350 million</u> total fixed supply of HVT, No more HVT will ever be created.

## HVT will be distributed as Follows:

* 250 million HVT (71.43% of the supply) will be airdropped to the EOS community
* 50 million HVT ( 14.29% of the supply) will be allocated to the HireVibes launch team using a vesting schedule
* 40 million HVT (11.43% of the supply) will be allocated to the HireVibes partnership fund which will be managed by HireVibes Foundation; the partnership fund exists to secure the partners that will support the DAPP and build the HireVibes ecosystem
* 10 million HVT (2.86% of the supply) will be used to setup the HireVibes Foundation; the HireVibes Foundation is responsible for ongoing DAPP development and exists to support the growth of the HireVibes ecosystem

## HireVibes Launch Team Vesting schedule:
* The HV Launch team will receive 40% of their individual stakes upon the HireVibes Dapp launching.
* Each individual team member will receive 20% every 6 months after HireVibes Dapp launch.
* This means the Launch team wonâ€™t receive all their tokens until after 18 months.

## HireVibes Surplus Tokens:
HireVibes Dapp will receive a small portion of HVT upon every job fill it facilitates (2.5% of the rate / salary in question). So what will happen to these surplus tokens that get generated from using the HireVibes Dapp?

* 50% of all surplus tokens generated will go straight to HVT token holders daily
- There will be a minimum distribution total; which means if the total doesn't get achieved within that 24 hour period, it could tick over to the following day for distributing, and so on
* 50% of all surplus tokens will go to a Working Proposal smart contract for the token holders to vote on
- To incentivise voter participation; we are exploring to set the 50% surplus token reward distribution in a more granular way whereby: If a HVT holder hasn't voted on anything for the last 4 weeks (for example) their wallet will get only 10% of the rewards that its supposed to get according to their proportional HVT stake. The remaining 90% can be spread into DAC pool for a Community vote. This will be announced prior to launch.

The HireVibes DAC (decentralised autonomous community) can vote to:

* Support, grow or create: Humanitarian and environmental initiatives
* Grow the HireVibes eco-system and make improvements and to the Jobs Dapp
* Create educational programmes
* Purchase property for the benefit of HV eco-system
* Anything else the community votes (This includes the option of additional distribution of surplus tokens back to the HVT token holders)

`The vote will be based on proportional representation of stake in HVT.`
