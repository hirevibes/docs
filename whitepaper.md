## 1. Introduction

HireVibes is an crowdsourcing jobs Dapp that will empower.

People to:
1. Find jobs: With the help of the crowd via targeted and private referrals
2. Get paid: In cryptocurrency (and fiat tbc)
3. Earn more: A 5% bonus in HireVibe Tokens (HVT) on top of pay
4. Give back: Securely donate HVT to humanitarian and environmental initiatives with a HVT fund equivalent to 1% of their annual rate or salary

Individuals, teams, startups, businesses, non-profits and other decentralised communities to:
1. Hire: With the wisdom of the crowd by incentivised referrals
2. Pay: In cryptocurrency (and fiat tbc)
3. Reduce hiring costs: Using HireVibes Dapp platform costs half of the average price of using a centralised recruitment agency
4. Give back: Enable each new hire made to give back by donating HVT to humanitarian and environmental initiatives of their choice 

**HireVibes at a high level**

HireVibes will provide a "decentralised" community based alternative to the traditional ‘’centralised’’ recruitment agency business model. HireVibes Dapp will transform the hiring and jobs marketplace by:
 
1. Empowering crowdsourcing. HireVibes Dapp will incentivise the public crowd and niche talent communities to become the primary sourcing stream of candidates for job openings globally, which is known as crowdsourcing. When it comes to searching for someone or something, ten sets of eyes have a greater chance of finding that someone or something than any one individual pair of eyes can offer. With potentially thousands and millions of active users operating globally off a Decentralised application; HireVibes can offer a genuine synergy of sourcing ability waiting to be tapped into. 
2. Integrating giving back to the environment and humanitarian projects as a fixed component of each job fill made through the platform.
3. Harnessing the benefits and security of blockchain technology to transparently and efficiently operate a decentralised community-governed application.

**HireVibes at a more detailed level**
 
HireVibes Dapp will improve the core aspects of the ‘standard economic deal’ when applied to the hiring process: 

* **Search:** How jobseekers, referrers; start-ups, employers, orgs and DAC's find each other using the power of referrals and aligned incentives via crowdsourcing
* **Negotiations:** How jobseekers, referrers and start-ups, employers, orgs that use HireVibes Dapp to find a new job or a new hire will get a better deal overall compared to when using traditional centralised recruitment agency services
* **Performance:** How HireVibes will improve the candidate and hiring manager experience. HireVibes Dapp will become a home for the jobseeker where users can build their own personal data stores and control who has access to this information. 

On the employer side, HireVibes Dapp will be a one-stop hiring shop where a hirer can advertise for free, crowdsource candidates, manage CV applications, communicate in-app and later; hire and pay securely all from one single platform.

* **Post-performance incentive:** Each new hire will get rewarded with a 5% token reward in HireVibe Tokens (HVT), on top of pay, which contains a fixed 1% Donation Fund to support Humanitarian and Environmental initiatives and projects of the new hires’ choice using HireVibe Tokens.

## 2. HireVibes Mission
Humanity’s skills and energy or ‘HR’ could be channelled better to help clean the environment and create abundance for all that live on the planet. HireVibes Dapp aims to redirect the flow of wealth going to centralised agencies into a river of resources for people and the planet using cryptocurrencies, smart contract technology and swarm intelligence methodologies.
## 3. HireVibes Structure and Chosen Blockchain
HireVibes will be an open source crowdsourcing jobs Dapp on the EOS.IO software. HireVibes Dapp will be governed by the HireVibes Decentralised Autonomous Community (DAC) using HireVibe Tokens.
## 4. HireVibes Rewards Model 
HireVibes Dapp will do the core work that a centralised ‘recruitment’ agency or freelance marketplace would normally do: by connecting jobseekers with permanent, contract and freelance job opportunities worldwide based on their desired conditions. 

Upon successful hires, HireVibes Dapp will charge a small token amount of (7.5%) to the hirer / employer based on the salary, rate or total price of the job in question. 

However; following a certain period of time after the new hire begins his/ her job, HireVibes Dapp will automatically redistribute (5%) or (67% of the total 7.5% token amount) back to the successful candidate, broken down as follows;

A) If the user applied directly to the job ad at the beginning of the process:
* (4%) token reward is sent to the placed candidate in HireVibes tokens (HVT)
* (1%) donation fund is sent to the placed candidate for donating to Humanitarian and Environmental initiatives and eco-friendly projects of their choice using (HVT)

B) If the placed candidate was referred to the job ad at the beginning of the process:
* (2%) token reward is sent to the placed candidate in HireVibes tokens (HVT)
* (2%) token reward is sent to the referrer in HireVibes tokens (HVT)
* (1%) donation fund is sent to the placed candidate for donating to Humanitarian and Environmental initiatives and eco-friendly projects of their choice using (HVT)

## 5. Payment terms based on Job type
HireVibes Dapp will add in a lock-in period to all contracts made between a hirer and a candidate. Meaning; each successful candidate won’t receive their HVT token reward immediately. This reduces the risk of a candidate taking a job just so they can get their HVT and leave.  Escrow services will also be in-built to the HireVibes freelance model.
- Permanent = 30 Days lock-in period 

Meaning when a new hire starts a perm role they found on HireVibes; that user will receive their 5% HVT reward 30 days after start date 
(no payroll option, just a 7.5% token amount)

- Contract = 14 Days lock-in period

Meaning when a new Contractor starts a contract role they found on HireVibes; that user will receive their 5% HVT reward 14 days after start date 
(payroll option and 7.5% token amount)

- Freelance = 7 days lock in period 

Meaning when a Freelancer starts a freelance role they found on HireVibes; that user will receive their 5% HVT reward 7 days after start date 
(payments and 7.5% token amount)

## 6. Value Proposition 

By financially and ethically incentivising the crowd to source candidates (which is a form of ‘crowdsourcing’) with a 5% reward; HireVibes will attract a larger quantity and higher quality of direct and referred CV applications to open job ad’s, making it easier for hirers to consistently make the right hires in an efficient and cost-effective way that generates highly positive PR for their employer brand.

When it comes to sourcing technical IT talent for example; the technical talent themselves are the best people to find other technical talent because they are the domain experts in this field and these people know the job spec and the required profile better than anyone else. So by outsourcing the ‘sourcing’ to the crowd, employers will gain access to a wider network of domain experts to source the talent they are looking for.

Enabling users to earn a cryptocurrency token reward when finding a new job for themselves or their peers, while also making a positive and quantifiable contribution to the environment; both combined, create positive experiences and good vibes for the jobseeker, the hirer and the community at large. 

## 7. Hiring Manager Experience and Benefits
Here are the main advantages of using HireVibes DAC for sourcing and hiring talent:
* **Free to advertise job ad’s on HireVibes.io** 
This is a risk-free solution as hirers only pay for results i.e. when a hire is made – which is the opposite to paying for a traditional job board listing up front and then ‘praying’ for good suitable applications to arrive.
* **Reduced cost**
The cost of using HireVibes Dapp is a 7.5% token amount upon successful hires if no add-on service is selected. This is half the cost compared to the 15% industry average fee on permanent jobs, and much less than half of the 25% average fee charged by centralised agencies on contract jobs.
* **Public referrals campaign**
This creates a new brand engagement stream for the Employer. HireVibes turns the public crowd into brand ambassadors by economically and environmentally incentivising referrals.
* **High quality hires**
Mean higher quality hires and research shows that referred candidates stay in the job longer on average.
* **Positive PR** 
The 1% Donation fund (equivalent to 1% of the annual salary / rate in question) creates positive PR and CSR to promote each Employer’s Brand
* **Happy and engaged new starters** 
By receiving a token reward that includes a donation a certain number of days after start date, the new hire will be happier and more engaged which will massively reduce the risk of the new starter leaving. The token reward will act as a loyalty incentive and will overall produce a happy user experience for the candidate 
* **Branded Advertisements**
This removes the secrecy around what the ‘client’ is so the employer brand will receive a lot more traffic and exposure to the talent market

## 8. Employer Branding: Merging Hiring and CSR
Employer branding is the key activity to every successful long term hiring strategy. 

Having a strong employer brand adds value to an employer's job offers and services to external candidates and clients. Given the increasing competition for talent; branding has become progressively more vital for finding and retaining the best candidates. 

HireVibes will be an Employer Branding platform aswel as a hiring platform. By implementing ‘giving back’ as part of the hiring process will enhance the image and reputation of companies, start-ups and decentralised organisations etc that advertise on HireVibes. 

These organisations that actively demonstrate their values and commitment to caring for the environment will have a competitive advantage in the hiring marketplace over those who don’t. It shows these org’s are serious about their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and that they are aligned to the values and desires of modern day people and the millennial age group specifically, who are becoming the largest majority of the labour market and they want to work for more than just money.

## 9. Donation Tracking 
All recipients of donations will be required to provide proof of how the donation was spent as part of the smart contract agreement. 

## 10. Growth Model 
To drive new hirers to HireVibes Jobs Dapp, the HireVibes Foundation or HireVibes DAC (TBC) will grow a team of recruitment facilitators (called HireVibe Recruiters) to work remotely off HireVibes. 

HireVibe Recruiters will be incentivised to grow their own network and business within the wider HireVibes network by building relationships with their local talent and local employers to facilitate their hiring needs via HireVibes Dapp. Remote HireVibe Recruiters will also be targeted and measured to also add employers to HireVibes Dapp who do not require a facilitation service from the HireVibe Recruiter team. If an employer does require facilitation, HireVibe Recruiters will be available to assist for an added fee [min 2.5% - max 5%]. The exact fee can be agreed between the HireVibe Recruiter and the employer.

This additional facilitation service by a Remote HireVibe Recruiter will bring the total cost to the employer to 10% - 12.5% of the salary / rate of the job in question. This is still significantly less than the global average fee charged by traditional centralised employment agencies of 15% - 30%+ on Permanent and Contract job fills. 
## 11. Marketing Strategy
Outbound marketing: The HireVibe Recruiter team will be tasked with adding new jobs and Employers to HireVibes Dapp. This team will be like a global sales / customer service team who will:

1. Pitch HireVibes cost effective service to new hirers to advertise their job vacancies on HireVibes Dapp
* Upsell to facilitate the hiring process for an extra (2.5% - 5%) fee
* Share Job ad’s across social media to generate attention and CV applications
* Source externally of HireVibes if needed but submitting all CV’s through the HireVibes Dapp with consent of the candidate.
2. Inbound marketing via: 
* By simply having open and live job ads on our platform will naturally attract new jobseekers and referrers to the HireVibes.io website
* Contextual content marketing via blogging and social media
* Announcing new affiliate partnerships: including new Environmental and Humanitarian Initiatives and new employers that join HireVibes Dapp
* Show a live counter covering statistics of the crypto rewards earned by jobseekers and referrers on HireVibes Dapp and the subsequent stream of donations that followed from it
* Referral Marketing: The core referrals mechanism of HireVibes will naturally drive new jobseekers and thus new employers to HireVibes DAPP.

## 12. Positive Impact Projections <small>(generated from HireVibes Dapp Donation portal)</small>
These are estimated spin-off projections based off of the projected HireVibe Recruiters’ Target KPI’s (This is still to be decided and will be announced prior to HV Dapp launching.)

Using [WeForst.org](http://weforst.org) (who can plant 1 tree for 1 euro) as a beneficiary of the 1% donation fund (using euro as an example)

| 1. Recruiter        | Weekly           | Monthly  | Annually  |  
| ------------- |-------------:| -----:|-----:|
| Hires facilitated| 1.25 | 5 | 60 |
| Donations Value @1% per hire (€500 per €50K salary)|€625|€2,500|€30,000|
| No of Trees planted @ €1|625|2500| 30,000|
|100 HV Recruiters| 62,500 | 250,000 |3,000,000|

`= 1 HireVibe Recruiter can help plant 500 trees per week and 30,000 per year.`

Using WellsForZoe as a beneficiary of the 1% donation fund (who can construct a well in East Aftrica for €250 to provide water to 300 people for life) 

| 1. Recruiter        | Weekly           | Monthly  | Annually  |  
| ------------- |-------------:| -----:|-----:|
|Donations Value @1% per hire (€500)|€625|€2,500|€30,000|
|No of wells built @ €250|2.5|10| 120 |
|X 300 people benefited per well| 750 | 3,000 | 36,000|

So:

* A team of 100 HireVibe Recruiters could potentially help provide water for life to 75,000 people per week, 300,000 people per month, 3.6 million+ people potentially per year.
* @10,000 recruiters (Close to a top 5 recruitment agency Size) Using WellsForZoe model = 360 million people annually would be guaranteed water for life.

## 13. Primary Target Market

The Hiring and recruitment market is growing annually at circa 12% - 20%. The HireVibe Recruiting team may initially focus on IT and Blockchain related jobs globally as IT related talent and startups, DAC’s etc will most likely be the early adopters HireVibes Dapp.

In 2016, the global staffing market generated 428 billion US dollars of revenue and is expected to grow 5% in 2018 (Staffingindustry.com).

Penetrating the rest of the professional hiring markets like: Finance, Sales and Marketing, Multilingual etc will be HireVibe Recruiter’s team second goal.

## 16. HireVibes DAC Governance Layer Proposal
This is a governance layer we are exploring implementing to the HireVibes DAC. HireVibes DAC will also be subject to the EOS.IO governance and arbitration systems at all times.

The HireVibes Governance model, managed by HV token holders, will be the backbone to the long term success of this organisation. The governance model employed by HireVibes DAC will iterate and evolve overtime as the DAC grows. 

Dispute Resolution (TBC): 

Aspects of the dispute resolution model will be based on the Brehon Law law system. 

Brehon Law is a polycentric legal system which means that the laws are actually created by the people themselves. This stateless legal system operated in Ireland for over 3,000 years. It has been proven to be one of the most used and harmonious law systems to be integrated by people all around planet Earth. Brehon Law is similar in its core to most indigenous law systems as seen from tribes in the Amazon to the aboriginal people of Australia, to the Native American Indians to the ancient Irish people.

The common traits of the same Law model seem to naturally emerge as the primal governance model when people are left alone to organise themselves without any interference from centralised or monarchical authorities.

Some of the main governance features that could be integrated to HireVibes DAC Governance Layer include:

* An open Arbitrator application process: meaning anyone can apply to be an arbitrator on HireVibes DAC and earn HVC tokens for finding harmonious outcomes to disputes that happen on the network. The most qualified Arbitrators with the best reputations will be the most selected and used
* Each arbitrator must add a certain % to the pot of each case as surety that the right decision will be made.
* Restorative Justice; meaning the arbitrator aims to find a harmonic solution for both parties, not just the victim
* Compensatory justice: Every ‘lapse in one’s own honour’ (bad action) can be resolved with paying a level of fair compensation
* Meritocracy: Titles aren’t given to people, they are earned by action and merit
* Full disclosure: All previous disputes rulings will remain open to community inspection whereby if at any time a better solution is found that should have been implemented; then a proposal can be made for a new transaction to be made to implement the new better solution as voted by the community. 

## 17. HireVibes Foundation (TBC)
The HireVibes Foundation (A GMBH not for profit entity that’s in the process of being established in Switzerland) will be a service provider and legal interface for HireVibes DAC. 

This Foundation will be directed by HireVibes DAC and it will also be transparent to the HireVibes DAC by reporting monthly activity.

The HireVibes Foundation’s goals will be to promote and assist the research and development of decentralised solutions that generate harmony and clear value for people and the planet.  

The Foundation will distribute use any excess income over expenditure to worthy causes while also using it to expand the Foundations’ service provision capabilities to HireVibes DAC

One of the HireVibes Foundations new initiatives we are planning to create is to implement volunteering recruitment and skill-sharing matching to HireVibes DAPP (free of charge)

HireVibes Foundation may partner with 3rd party providers for providing exchange services between Fiat and cryptocurrency to hirers and candidates. This will be announced prior to launching.
